# StegaINR
This is the official code for "[Hiding Functions within Functions: Steganography by Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04743)"  
# Running the code
This code requires Python 3. 
# Acknowledgements
Generative Models as Distributions of Functions [neural-function-distributions](https://github.com/EmilienDupont/neural-function-distributions) models are used to implement StegaINR.
